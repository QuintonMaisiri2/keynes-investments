                  Hamdan Alketbi is the Founder and President of{" "}
                  <strong className="text-primary">Keynes Investments</strong>, a student-led investment club managing a
                  diversified AED 70,000 portfolio. Under his leadership, the club applies value investing principles
                  inspired by Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham, combining disciplined analysis with a forward-looking
                  approach to global markets.

                  exchanges (ADX and DFM) and another on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), focusing on market structure,
                  liquidity, tracking error, and investor outcomes.
